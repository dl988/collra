- File and folder structure:
	+ folder components: we should use bower_component to manage.
	+ file js/static.js: is a static server
		How to use it: 
			+ install: npm install connect serve-static -g
			+ run: node js/server.js
			+ test: http://localhost:8888/
			
- Css compiler: We will use Less.js (to quickly use LessCss)

- Naming convention: We will use the prefix for all block: b-name-block (ex: b-header, b-sidebar...)
