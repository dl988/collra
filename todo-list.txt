<!----- Summary: -------->

- Almost the functions are worked, not include (as Martin suggest):
 + Filter search result
 + Make animation of all the featured items in the sidebar
 
- Need to resolve:
 + UI/UX: should show a loading when init the layout or infinite scroll. The image of items are fill width so can be scale... 
 + Performance: avoid using detach and append when click on a item (heavy to load if too more item...). In production should build the lessCss to css first.
 + Test: need more device to test (Mac OS, iphone, ipad...)
 + Refactor: Using a popup for the detail item
 
 - Timeline:
  + setup working environment: 3h
  + research: 3h
  + implement:
    1. level 1 - html & css & responsive (header, sidebar, grid): 8h
	2. level 1 - javascript (header, sidebar, grid) include implement, improvement, refactor, debug and fix bugs: 28h
	3. level 2 - infinite scroll, include implement, improvement, refactor, debug and fix bugs: 8h
